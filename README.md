# Project1

Elevator Pitch:
The game is a scrolling style game and will be 2D. Main character will be SailorMoon(maybe). She has to get home after a long day of fighting crime, but the road she usually takes has been closed off and she has to take the backroad home. However, there are a variety of obstacles that she has to either jump over or duck under. Sailormoon will be continuously running and the player will have the ability to control when she jumps or ducks. The score will be calculated by the amount of time that the player survives. As the player moves forward Sailormoon will move faster and there will be more obstacles appearing on screen/ on the road that she is has to avoid.

Tech Stack: HTML, JS, CSS, phaser.io(maybe) or createJS(maybe).
My plan for the background is to have a sunset sky color style with clouds. Then a path that Sailormoon will be walking on and where all the obstacles will be.
A score will appear on the right hand corner of the game. Score will be calculated by distance travelled.
Collision detection will be calculated with a function the object will have a position on the x-y axis and have a set height and width.
